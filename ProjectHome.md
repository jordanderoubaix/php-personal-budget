This project was developed so a user can have a simple web application where they can keep track of their budget and spending.

The code will be added to the repository in the next few days. We are looking for people to test once the code is made available. I will try to have regular download packages so you can easily get the code without pulling it from CVS.

Welcome to **James Meyer** to the team. He will be consulting with me on design issues.
